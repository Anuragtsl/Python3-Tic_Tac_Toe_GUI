# Python3-Tic_Tac_Toe_GUI

I have made a GUI app for Tic Tac Toe game.
You can just simply download the code and can run it using any Python's IDE.

# Library Used

I have used tkinter library (Python3) for creating this project 

You can learn more about @Tkinter at https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

I have used Pycharm IDE [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/] for coding!

Run main.py to start the GUI app!

#Njoy!!
